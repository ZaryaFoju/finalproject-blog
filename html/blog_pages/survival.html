        <p class="essaywrite">&emsp;Many qualities in a person can dictate whether or not they can survive in a difficult situation. Qualities include critical thinking, the ability to make tough decisions, and difficult situations. Though there are many qualities that determine this, some are more important than others, and without those certain qualities, you would not be able to survive extremely difficult situations. The essential qualities that help us survive are critical thinking skills and the ability to make tough decisions because, without them, you wouldn’t be able to make the tough decisions that will help you survive in those situations.</p>
        <p class="essaywrite">&emsp;Being able to critically think is important because it allows you to make the best decisions despite the circumstances that you are in. An example of someone who managed to survive because of their critical thinking skills is Aron Ralston. Ralston was able to survive because he had made the important decision of amputating his arm. Most who don’t have the ability to think and make those types of decisions would have cracked under pressure and would have not been able to survive in that situation. One of the main reasons that Ralston was able to survive was that he had thought of his situation and understood what he had to do to get out of it. In this way, critical thinking allows people to make logical decisions in very dangerous situations.</p>
        <p class="essaywrite">&emsp;Now, some might say that something like determination is more important than making tough decisions. But not being able to make those decisions will be very detrimental to you, even if you have the will to live. For instance, once I was trapped between a wall and a large bin in my house. I was trying to shimmy through it so that I could make it to the other side. At that moment, when I was stuck, I had to make the tough decision to sacrifice my leg (by scraping it on the bin) in order to get out. Because I had made that decision, I was able to get out of that area (with small injuries on my legs). Making tough decisions, when in difficult situations, is vital to getting someone out.</p>
        <p class="essaywrite">&emsp;Having the ability to make tough decisions, as well as being able to make critical decisions are essential qualities that are vital to the survival of a person. The quality of making tough decisions is key to survival because you can realize and make tough decisions that will help you survive. Critical thinking skills allow you to think logically and clearly in difficult situations which can help you survive longer. To have these qualities is important and all should have these two qualities for survival.</p>
