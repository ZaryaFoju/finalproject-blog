        <p>The sunlight burned brightly against the bud, just as rain pelted onto the petals. The light rain droplets had started running down the petals, gathering on the tip and threatening to fall. A sight that would've been ethereal, mystical even, if not for the droplet falling, and dissolving through the body right below the petals.</p>
        <p>Wise, and knowing eyes regarded the body. The person was just recently decomposed, certain parts of the body being dissolved through by the acidic plant towering above it. A nasty sight it was, full of holes made by an acid, dissolving, yet no flies revolved around it. After all, the plant had already staked its claim over its prey, with burning liquid and melting guts.</p>
        <p>'Another one. Recently deceased, the skinny body suggests starvation, the approximate time of death being less than 5 hours ago. And…’ The woman pursed her lips in thought. ‘The holes suggest a fast-acting acid with a pH level of.. -27.’ A sigh left her lips, the gas mask obstructing most of her breath from leaving. She turned swiftly on her heel, it was already too late to attempt removal for further observation. </p>
        <p>It wasn't too much of a loss, after all, there were hundreds of millions more bodies at the mercy of these plants waiting for studying.</p>
        <p>Larissa quietly opened the front door, tiptoeing through the darkness. A sigh left her lips at finally being home, as much as she loves research; it's been too long of a day. Unfortunately, the corpses she had picked up don't store themselves.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>“Experimental dissection log No. 2743.” The hologram pans to the mortuary table right below it. </p>
        <p>Cyrus suddenly feels his throat constrict. He tries to fight the gag clawing its way out of his throat, but the pure disgust and grotesque... It was too much. Cyrus fell to his knees, the hard cold floor doing little to nothing to break his fall. His hands grasp his throat. Nails are clawing, scratching, breaking, at his throat. He feels his skin rip, yet he continues to claw. Panting. Gasping, shallow breaths barely reach him. He can't breathe. He can't breathe. He can't BREATHE. A violent retch shudders through him. Blurry, tears he realizes, just as another vicious retch forces its way up his throat. His body is shaking, quivering on the floor. He's left dry heaving on the floor. His stomach is desperately trying to force out bile. Blood rushes to his ears, and all the world spins in his vision. </p>
        <p>“This particular type of plant is very new. It seems to be a recent mutation of mold.” Larissa's voice cuts through him, leaving him to look up at the camera. </p>
        <p>“There are no present government records detailing this fungus.” The hologram showed his sister, skillfully cutting through what he assumes is the decaying stomach through his tears.</p>
        <p>"The mold is very resilient, as it survives and thrives on stomach acid. Perhaps this particular variant has evolved to eat acids with levels of 1.5-3.5.”</p>
        <p>He can't hold or stop it anymore. The bile starts to come up his throat, climbing through it as it burns his esophagus—</p>
        <p>“Looking more deeply at the lungs, there are no signs of infected areas. Seeing the trachea too, this particular mold does not infect hosts through the lungs. The variant only infects through ingestion and digestion."</p>
        <p>He retches, bile spilling from his mouth. It stings. It doesn’t stop.</p>
        <p>"From this, I can deduct that the mold only grows in highly acidic conditions—”</p>
        <p>He shuts it down before he can see more. </p>
        <p>A few more heaves leave him shuddering on the cold, unforgiving basement floor. Looking down he can see his vomit and how the impact on his knees bruised them. Gently, his fingers come over to massage the bruise. The same fingers that held Larissa's hands which she had used to cut open decaying corpses for her own gain.</p>
        <p>Slowly, carefully he looks down at his fingers. They felt <strong><em>dirty</em></strong>.</p>
        <p>He's been siblings with a sister who's been taking dead bodies off the streets and dissecting them, using them for her own sick research that even the government classifies as unethical. Yet, she was also the same sister who practically raised him.</p>
        <p>The one who took him to flower fields whenever he wanted, the same sister who patted his head all the time because he has always and will always be shorter than her. The same older sister who might've purposely infected and murdered hundreds all because she wants to see the effect that those corrosive plants have on living subjects.</p>
        <p>'Larissa was always one to consider every and all possibilities after all.’ Cyrus thinks. Images of his sister using those helpless, unwilling people for her own experiments flash through his mind.</p>
        <p>He feels sick again.</p>
        <p>Cyrus shakes his head, looking down at the rancid pile of bile on the floor, and back up at the shelf of experiment logs. How little does he know about his own sister? He had never seen anything amiss, or, or insanity, or anything. Just how much was she hiding from their parents? From him?</p>
        <p>Taking a shaky breath, Cyrus’ eyes harden with determination, ‘I need to know more.’</p>
        <p><strong>To be continued...</strong></p>
