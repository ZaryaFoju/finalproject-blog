        <p><em>Analysis based on passage: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/in-la-rinconada-peru-searching-for-beauty-in-ugliness/2013/02/28/aa0dc6b2-7ad9-11e2-82e8-61a46c2cde3d_story.html"><strong>In La Rinconada, Peru, Searching for Beauty in the Ugliness</strong></a></em></p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p class="essaywrite">&emsp;The story, “In La Rinconada, Peru, Searching for Beauty in the Ugliness” begins with the history of La Rinconada, a small town that rests on the peak of Mount Ananea, known for its gold. Throughout the text, the author describes the terrible conditions that La Rinconada’s inhabitants have to experience on the mountain, the bad sanitation, and the little infrastructure. The author, Arana, takes a trip to La Rinconada and retells her experience while also going over the general information/history of La Rinconada, comparing the two forms of information in the text. In the text, “In La Rinconada, Peru, Searching for Beauty in Ugliness”, Arana uses a compare-and-contrast organizational structure to compare the history and conditions to her experience of seeing La Rinconada. This helps develop her thesis that moments of joy can exist even in a place like La Rinconada.</p>
        <p class="essaywrite">&emsp;At first, the author had expected La Rinconada to be a place where there was only suffering and hardship to be seen. The author includes information about the town to show this, stating, “... La Rinconada boasts few tourists, no hotel, no sites to speak of…” The author, however, contrasts the information with her experiences touring La Rinconada by saying, “I had every expectation that I would find hunger and hardship. What I had not expected was to find beauty in the ugliness.” The author originally expected to find only suffering in La Rinconada based on the information/history of the town, instead of finding beauty within the ugliness. By comparing and contrasting the conditions of La Rinconada with what she had experienced touring the town, Arana developed the thesis that moments of joy do exist within La Rinconada.</p>
        <p class="essaywrite">&emsp;When describing the working conditions of miners along with the people themselves, the author again uses a compare-and-contrast organizational structure to contribute to her thesis. In the text, Arana describes part of the ‘ugliness’ that exists in the town, the horrid conditions that many of the population are forced to work in. The text describes these conditions when it states, “...work outdoors is often done by women or children. The work in damp, freezing shafts is done by men.” Even despite these conditions, the author shows (from her experiences) how people still manage to find joy in such terrible conditions. The author describes a girl who lives in La Rinconada to illustrate this point, “I remembered the fiery spirit of Senna, a 14-year-old girl who could recite a string of verses…” This helps develop the thesis of moments of joy in La Rinconada by giving an instance of a person experiencing joy in La Rinconada despite all the terrible conditions that plague their day-to-day life.</p>
        <p class="essaywrite">&emsp;Throughout the text, the author includes information and history about La Rinconada; the terrible working and living conditions due to the existence of gold. Her experiences display that there is still beauty in a place like La Rinconada, contrasting with its history and the state it is in. By using a compare and contrast organizational structure, the author develops the thesis that moments of joy can occur even in La Rinconada.</p>
