        <p><em>This is a rewritten version of the ending to the story, "The Necklace", a short story by <a href="https://www.eastoftheweb.com/short-stories/UBooks/Neck.shtml"><strong>Guy de Maupassant</strong></a>.</em></p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>In that instant, Madame Loisel revealed an expression of disbelief. For ten years, she and her husband had worked so hard for an object that was a mere fake? She almost could not believe her own ears.</p>
        <p>“False? All along it was…fake?” Madame Loisel repeated slowly, mostly to herself.</p>
        <p>“Yes, yes! If you had told me that you had lost it back then, I would not have minded it at all. I only bought it because it looked pretty; it wasn’t anything of importance.”</p>
        <p>Madame Loisel was silent at the news, frozen still. Madame Forestier squeezed Madame Loisel’s hands in comfort. She had felt extreme pity for her, and she could not believe the state that Madame Loisel was in because of it. She even had wondered why Madame Loisel did not tell her of such things in the first place.</p>
        <p>Madame Loisel sighed, the shock of the news finally starting to dwindle. Strangely, despite the shock that she was first afflicted with, she had now felt a sense of relief overtake her. She huffed with a slightly annoyed expression on her face.</p>
        <p>“Well, there is nothing I can do about it now. I wish I would have told you sooner, but now it is too late,” Madame Loisel said.</p>
        <p>“I could give the necklace back to you. You worked for ten years to pay off the necklace, I would at least want you to get back the money that you worked so hard for.”</p>
        <p>“No need.”</p>
        <p>“Are you sure? Even if you managed to pay back your debts, I’m sure that doesn’t mean that you don’t need money…”</p>
        <p>“It is fine. The necklace was a repayment for what I had lost all those years ago. And, that necklace has caused me more problems than what it was worth. I do not need it nor do I want it.”</p>
        <p>The necklace had made her realize how bad some of her decisions were. Because she had wanted more, a better life, and a higher status, she had lost everything. It was good enough that the debt was paid. She did not wish for anything more than a fulfilling life.</p>
        <p>After catching up with Madame Forestier for a while, Madame Loisel had said her farewell and left. She continued with her routine, going to the fruit store and the grocer, returning home to see her husband working.</p>
        <p>She had stopped in front of Monsieur Loisel, wanting to deliver the news.</p>
        <p>“I learned something today. The necklace turned out to be false all along, only worth 500 francs.” She had delivered the news without warning, causing Monsieur Loisel to drop the papers that she had held in his hand.</p>
        <p>It had taken him a while to collect himself, but once he did he was just as nonchalant about it as Madame Loisel was. Both of them had come to terms with the fact, knowing that there was nothing that they could do about it.</p>
        <p>“I can’t believe it. This truly feels like it was all for nothing.” Monsieur Loisel shook his head with disbelief, a light smile on his face.</p>
        <p>Relief is what he had felt, glad that it wasn’t nearly as serious an issue then what he had first imagined. They had both felt guilt about the loss of the necklace causing them to do all this labor with little to no complaints.</p>
        <p>“She had even asked me if I had wanted it back. I said no, for good reason. Who knows what troubles the necklace could cause us if we have it again?”</p>
        <p>Monsieur Loisel chuckled. “You’re right about that.”</p>
        <p>It was early morning when, as she always did in the morning, Madame Loisel went out to take out the garbage. She had opened the front door of their small abode, only to be greeted by Madame Forestier. She was holding francs in her hand, the large amount making it difficult to hold on to them.</p>
        <p>“Jeanne? What are you doing here?”</p>
        <p>“I’m here to repay you. I know you would not like the necklace, but I could give you the francs it was worth. Here.”</p>
        <p>She handed Madame Loisel the money, 36,000 francs exactly. She stared at the money with a sigh before accepting it. With this money, they would easily be able to reach the status that they had before.</p>
        <p>“Thank you.”</p>
        <p>“Do not thank me, this is me repaying you. You are my friend Mathilde, and I do not want to struggle more because of a necklace of mine.”</p>
        <p>Madame Loisel started to tear up as she gave her friend a tight hug. With this, she and her husband had another chance. She was not going to ruin them the second time.</p>
