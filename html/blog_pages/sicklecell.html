        <p class="sicklewrite">&emsp;Sickle Cell, a disease first discovered by James Herrick, is a genetic mutation that creates abnormal hemoglobin in the body. For many people with sickle-cell disease, life is hard. People with sickle cell suffer from things such as anemia, vision loss, and even go through a pain crisis. Rarely can sickle cell ever be treated, as there are special requirements you need to meet to be cured. Overall, sickle cell is a chronic debilitating disease that affects millions globally resulting in a short life expectancy with no cure for most individuals. The cause of the disease is a genetic mutation of a gene that results in irregular hemoglobin, turning the red blood cells sickle; effects of this mutation are chronic pain, anemia, and stroke which are treated with the use of pain relievers, blood transfusions, and stem cell transplants to alleviate symptoms.</p>
        <p class="sicklewrite">&emsp;Sickle cell is a disease that derives from the mutation of the HBB gene. The mutation of the HBB gene causes a person to contract sickle cell or sickle cell trait (with sickle cell trait having fewer effects than sickle cell). Found in mostly African Americans, sickle cell anemia is a disease that is inherited from a parent. Although sickle cell is found mostly in African Americans, anyone who has a parent with sickle cell can get sickle cell. The mutation of the sickle cell gene causes the red blood cells to form an inflexible sickle (crescent-shaped tool). This change in the red blood cells causes many issues for the person that has sickle cell. For a person to get sickle cell, the person needs to have a parent who either has sickle cell or sickle cell trait. The chances depend on whether the person has a parent who has no mutation of the gene or a parent that may have a mutation (the more minor sickle cell trait or the more major sickle cell gene). For example, if the person were to have a parent with a sickle cell gene and a parent that doesn’t have sickle cell, the person would have sickle cell trait because they inherited one normal gene and one sickle cell gene. If the person were to have parents that have the sickle cell gene, the person would have sickle cell. If the person were to have one parent with sickle cell and the other with sickle cell trait, the person would have a 50% chance of having sickle cell and a 50% chance of having sickle cell trait. A person who has both parents with sickle cell trait would have a 25% chance of carrying sickle cell disease, a 50% chance of carrying sickle cell trait, and a 25% chance of being normal. And, if a person has both parents who have no mutation, they have no chance of having sickle cell. So, depending on what gene your parents have, you can get sickle cell or sickle cell trait. To diagnose a person that might have sickle cell, doctors use multiple methods to identify the mutated gene. One of the methods that doctors use to identify sickle cell within a person is isoelectric focusing. Isoelectric focusing is when hemoglobin molecules are placed in gel in which they are subjected to an electric current. Depending on the molecule’s change in electric charge (based on the pH of the gel), doctors can diagnose someone with sickle cell. Another method used to diagnose a person with sickle cell is the HPLC test. The test allows doctors to separate different types of hemoglobin from one another, allowing them to identify the sickle cell gene. Similar to isoelectric focusing, hemoglobin electrophoresis is another way doctors identify sickle cells in a person. Like isoelectric focusing, doctors use an electrically charged particle through the gel to test for sickle cell. Unlike isoelectric focusing, electrophoresis separates and measures out the different types of hemoglobin to test for sickle cell. Using these methods, doctors can diagnose a person with sickle cell.</p>
        <p class="sicklewrite">&emsp;Having sickle cell can cause many side effects within an individual. Different side effects can range from minor to severe. One of the milder effects of sickle cell is having a higher chance of getting infections. Because sickle cells cause damage to the spleen, the chances of the person getting an infection are higher. Although this symptom might not seem all that bad, infections can become more severe and even life-threatening to the individual. Another mild symptom of sickle cell is delayed growth. Younger people with sickle cell will experience delayed growth and puberty. This is because people with sickle cell experience a shortage of blood cells, causing delayed growth in people with sickle cell. The more severe symptoms of sickle cell are anemia and stroke. Anemia is a condition wherein someone lacks healthy red blood cells that carry oxygen to all parts of their body. This, in turn, causes the body to feel weak and tired. People with sickle cell get anemia because their red blood cells die early, causing the person to have a shortage of blood cells. Another severe disease that people with sickle cell can get is stroke. A stroke is what happens when there is a blockage of blood flow to the brain. Strokes cause loss of consciousness and can even lead to death if not given immediate medical treatment. People with sickle cells have a higher chance of stroke because their sickle cells are not as flexible as healthy red blood cells, causing blockages in the circulatory system to occur more often, resulting in a stroke. To avoid these symptoms from occurring, people with sickle cell have to avoid doing certain things. People with sickle cell have to avoid being overexerted, overexcited, and being in extreme weather conditions. Being in any one of these conditions can cause a person with sickle cell to go through a crisis. A crisis is an episode of pain that varies in intensity. It could be milder or it can be so painful that the person may require medical attention. A crisis can occur when a person is in extreme weather conditions, in an extreme emotional state, or when the person is hurt. So, in order to avoid a crisis, a person with sickle cell has to avoid being in these situations.</p>
        <p class="sicklewrite">&emsp;For most, there is no way to cure sickle cell. The only people who might be able to truly be cured of sickle cell disease are adolescents. However, people with sickle cell have many treatment options that can help relieve the symptoms of sickle cell. For instance, people with sickle cell can take personal measures to alleviate symptoms. They can make sure that they have a healthy body so that things like infections and other types of diseases occur less. They can make sure to have a proper diet and keep themselves hydrated so that their body is getting all the nutrients they need. Also, they can make sure to get vaccines regularly to prevent infection. Because people with sickle cell have a higher chance of infections, steps should be taken to visit their doctor to get vaccines regularly.  Although taking these measures may seem simple, these are important steps in preventing many sickle cell symptoms. More things that people can get to prevent chronic symptoms of sickle cell are blood transfusions and stem-cell transplants. A blood transfusion is when a person that might need healthy blood (a person with sickle cell) gets blood from a healthy donor that has a blood type that will be accepted by that person. Getting a blood transfusion can help people with sickle cell get the healthy blood they need to prevent these symptoms. However, there are many issues that come with getting a blood transfusion as the person might reject the blood given to them, causing more issues than when they just had sickle cell. A way to cure sickle cell (only adolescents) is to get a stem cell transplant. A stem cell transplant is a bone marrow transplant that gives a person the healthy stem cells of a donor. Stem cell transplant is risky and should only be attempted when all other methods have been found to be ineffective.</p>
        <p class="sicklewrite">&emsp;Sickle cell, a mutation inherited from a parent, causes many mild and even severe symptoms to the afflicted person. There are many different symptoms of this disease, such as anemia, delayed growth, and even stroke. Although it is chronic for most, steps can be taken to prevent/manage symptoms. A person with it can exercise and get vaccines regularly to prevent infection. They could also go to a doctor to get treatment for more severe symptoms and pain relief. So, even though it is a difficult disease to deal with, steps are taken to make sure a person with sickle cell has a better quality of life.</p>
