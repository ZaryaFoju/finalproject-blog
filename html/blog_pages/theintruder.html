        <p>“—there are now two murders that have been committed by the Avaricious Killer, making them a serial killer. Officials have told everyone to stay alert. Contact the authorities if you suspect someone or if a robbery and a murder has been committed in your area.”</p>
        <p>Penn quickly turned off the television. There was now a serial killer so close to his area? What if he is next? What if they enter his home and murder him?</p>
        <p>Penn sighed, “I really need to go to sleep.”</p>
        <p>Yawning, he walks to his room. He takes a quick shower and puts on some comfortable nightwear before going to bed. He closes his eyes and mumbles to himself, “Alright, just go to sleep and don’t overthink anything. Just go to sleep.”</p>
        <p>Just as Penn was about to fall asleep, a small thud and a creak at the front door made his eyes snap open. He looked around frantically and heard more footsteps that were walking to the living room of his apartment. Shifting to the floor, Penn scoots himself underneath the bed. He waits and hears the intruder walking to each of the rooms. They went from the living room to the kitchen, and to Frank’s room. He felt glad that Frank was working overtime.</p>
        <p>Footsteps moved closer to Penn’s door. Hearing this, he curled himself into a ball under the bed and waited. The intruder opened the door and walked around in his room. At this point, Penn tensed his muscles and held his breath. His sweat was dripping on his face.</p>
        <p>Looking from underneath the bed, Penn could see that the intruder was wearing comfortable clothes, as if they lived close by, and decided to come to his home on a whim. The other features, like their build, were indiscernible to the eye because it was dark. After what seemed to be a few minutes, which felt like hours to Penn, the trespasser left.</p>
        <p>“I need to get out of here,” he murmured to himself.</p>
        <p>He moved from underneath the bed and grabbed a random heavy object in his room and his phone to contact the police. Slowly, he opened the door of his room and tip-toed to the front door. Paying attention to the footsteps of the trespasser, he sneakily avoided confrontation with them. He was finally able to escape!</p>
        <p>Unlocking the door, Penn made sure that no creak slipped out as he opened the door. Suddenly, the door was shoved open by something that was pushing against it. It was a human body. Somebody was killed right at his doorstep. Looking closer, he saw that it was someone he knew.</p>
        <p>“Frank! Oh god.”</p>
        <p>He felt sick. The shuffling of footsteps to the front door made him realize that he spoke too loudly. It was too late; he was going to confront the killer. He held the heavy object tightly as the killer approached. Standing in front of the intruder allowed him to get a closer view of their appearance.</p>
        <p>She was a female that was slightly taller and older than him. She had dark hair, dark eyes, and a sharp weapon in her left hand. They stood still for a moment, sizing up one another. In a flash, the woman had run up to him, going for a stab to his abdomen but he had thrown the heavy object towards her face, making her temporarily stunned. He had stepped over Frank and started to run.</p>
        <p>While running, he had pulled out his phone and hurriedly dialed 9-1-1.</p>
        <p>“9-1-1, what’s your emergency?”</p>
        <p>“There’s someone in my apartment complex who tried to kill me! They’d killed my roommate and tried to kill me! Please help!” Penn replied.</p>
        <p>“What’s your location?”</p>
        <p>“45 Anderson Avenue Poughkeepsie, NY 12601. Please hurry!” Penn looked behind him.</p>
        <p>“We’re on our way.”</p>
        <p>The police eventually got there and caught the lady. The woman, Tara Coleman, turned out to be the Avaricious Killer who was near his area. Tara was planning to steal their belongings before murdering them but was unable to do so because of Penn’s awareness. Unfortunately, Frank was another casualty of the Avaricious Killer.</p>
        <p>A few months passed. During this time, Penn has taken up counseling to help deal with the trauma of that day, Frank had a funeral to honor him after his death, and Tara Coleman was finally sentenced to life in prison. Things have been slightly better for Penn, but he knows that things will never be able to go back to the way they were.</p>
